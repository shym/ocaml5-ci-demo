# OCaml 5.0.0 mingw-w64 with setup-ocaml

This repository demonstrates the temporary use of the [windows-5.0](https://github.com/dra27/opam-repository/tree/windows-5.0)
branch as an opam remote to allow using OCaml 5 on mingw-w64 with opam-repository-mingw.

The process should become obsolete with opam 2.2.0~alpha1
